ID:---
## Reserve ID:  user id upto 500 are reserverd for system users.
## Unreserverd ID: ID above 100 are unreserved for all new user creation.

Note: cat /etc/login.defs
      UID_MIN 1000    # this is the unreserved ID starting for UID.
      GID_MIN 1000    # this is the unreserved ID starting for GID.
**** it is recommended not to raise IDs reserved by system above 500 to avoid conflict with systems that retain the 500 limit.      

UMASK:
        - It defines the default permission for new files created.
          $ umask  or umask -S
          
USERADD:
          - $ useradd -N demouser       >>> User will be created without UPG(User private group)
          - $ useradd -g "prm" -G "secd" demouser    >> user created with primary group "prm" & secondary group "secd"
          - $ useradd -M username          
          NOTE:- If you do not want to create the home directory for the user at all, you can do so by running useradd
with the -M option. However, when such a user logs into a system that has just booted and their home
directory does not exist, their login directory will be the root directory. If such a user logs into a system
using the su command, their login directory will be the current directory of the previous user.
    
          - $ useradd -r admin1     >> create system user with reserved UID, i.e. between 0-500.

USERDEL:  - $ userdel -r testuser   >> delete user "testuser" along with files & folder in home dir. Except files in other file system.
          - $ userdel -f testuser   >>> delete the user even if the user is logged in.
          
LSLOGIN:    - $ lslogin       >> list the comprehensive overview of users and groups, their login activities.
            - $ lslogin ravi or lslogin 601     >> display information for user ravi or for user with UID 601.
            - $ lslogins --logins=0,500,jdoe,esmith \       >> shows multiple user info with username or UID.
            
GROUPADD:   - $ groupadd admin      >> setup new group "admin"
            - $ groupadd -g 765 operator       >> setup group "operator" and assign GID as 765.
            - $ groupadd -f operator      >> force the group creation.

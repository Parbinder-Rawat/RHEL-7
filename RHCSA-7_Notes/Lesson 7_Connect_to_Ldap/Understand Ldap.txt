****LDAP: ****
LDAP is a light weight directory access protocol. It connects to the directory server, which is heirarcal in its setup.

Heirarcal means somewhat same as DNS. i.e.

server.rhatcert.com  >>> DNS name

	Here, 	com --->>> Top level domain.
	      	rhatcert --->>> Sub-domain.
		server --------->>> Leave object with name server.

It is pretty much same as DNS objects but with little modification.
	DNS name is :
			lisa.rhatcert.com

	ldap name is genrally containerized as :
			cn=lisa, dc=rhatcert, dc=com


- provides easy way for the centralised authentication server.
- easy to hook-up multiple computer to one ldap server, i.e. we just have to create one user account.

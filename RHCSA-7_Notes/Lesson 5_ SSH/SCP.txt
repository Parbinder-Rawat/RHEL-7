SCP Secure copy is the other feature of SSH:

$ scp testfile user@server2.com:~
			Here, we are copying the testfile from current directory of source m/c to ~ of server2 host.

$ scp -P 2022 testfile user@server2.com:~ 
			Here, P (Uppercase) is used for specifying the port. (lower case p is reserved).
			      p (Lowercase) is for presering the file permission while copying.

SSH Working:

1. ssh_client (CLIENT M/C) use $ ssh parbs@server.com, which will send the request to server.com.
2. ssh_server (SERVER M/C) will send the public security key (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub) to CLIENT M/C,
    where CLIENT M/C receive a prompt to accept the key.
3. If user in CLIENT M/C finds the key is geniune, key will be accepted typing 'Yes' in the prompt,
    and this public key of the server will get stored in the file ~/.ssh/known_hosts. 
4. Then user in the CLIENT M/C get the prompt to put password, if password is correct, session is establishes
    and connection is Successfull!.

KEY Based Authentication:

1. Generate Key:
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048	>>> generate the rsa key for your account.
				Where,  -t for type of authentication i.e. rsa, ecdsa, etc.
					-b for byte size for key, here it is selected 2048 bytes, default is 1024 bytes.
2. with above command, 2 key files (Private and public) are created in ~/.ssh/ 
		i.e, 
			id_rsa 
			id_rsa.pub

3. Need to copy the public key file created in above steps to the target host for key-based authentication.
	$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server1.com	Where, i is for identity file.

		One have to enter the password at this step and once authenticated, we are all good.

4. Done!, next login will be key-based for this user.
